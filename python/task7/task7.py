1. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50.
H is 30.
D is a variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

2. Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which
takes length as argument. Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape
where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.
